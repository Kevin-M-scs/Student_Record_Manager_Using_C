### Student_Record_Manager_Using_C
**Author: Kevin M**
This Menu Driven C program uses Text files to manage student records for Tuitions. 
It stores data datewise and has a variety of display options.
Efforts have been made to make this program as user friendly as possible so that even those without much technical experience can use it.
The program tries to tackle all possible mistakes during input.
MinGW32 has been used hence the command to run the Makefile is: mingw32-make
*Please ensure that the make utitlity package has been installed beforehand*
