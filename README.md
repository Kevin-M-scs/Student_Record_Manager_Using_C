### Student_Record_Manager_Using_C
**Author: Kevin M**<br>
This Menu Driven C program uses Text files to manage student records for Tuitions.<br> 
It stores data datewise and has a variety of display options.<br>
Efforts have been made to make this program as user friendly as possible so that even those without much technical experience can use it.<br>
The program tries to tackle all possible mistakes during input.<br>
MinGW32 has been used hence the command to run the Makefile is: mingw32-make<br>
*Please ensure that the make utitlity package has been installed beforehand*<br>
